# Theory 
In all the previous experiments, we dealth with codes over binary alphabet. Codes can also be constructed over fields of size greater than $2$. In this experiment, we shall focus on finite fields in general. We will describe prime fields, construction of fields of size which is a power of prime, primitive element of a field, minimal polynomials and sub-fields of a finite field.

The theory associated with Experiment-6 is divided into six parts:

(1) Prime Fields  <br />
(2) Ring of polynomials and Extended Euclidean algorithm  <br />
(3) Construction of finite fields of prime power  <br />
(4) Primitive Element of a field  <br />
(5) Minimal Polynomials  <br />
(6) Sub-fields of a field  <br />
